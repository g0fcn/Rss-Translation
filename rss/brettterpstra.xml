      <title>CurlyQ 和自动化 JavaScript 执行</title>
      <link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16641718/curlyq-and-automated-javascript-execution</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ gem install curlyq, JavaScript execution, screenshot command, execute subcommand, web automation tool 

总结: 作者在文章中介绍了对CurlyQ工具的改进，包括添加JavaScript执行功能、改进截图命令、新增执行子命令等。通过对工具的升级，用户可以更方便地进行网页自动化操作，如保存网页截图、执行特定脚本等。这些改进将极大地提高用户的工作效率，特别适用于自动化文档生成等工作。CurlyQ的最新版本已可通过gem install curlyq进行更新或安装。 
I’ve been wanting to add JavaScript execution to CurlyQ for a while and finally got around to it.
In case you’ve missed it, CurlyQ is my command-line web automation tool for fetching, parsing, and responding to web page content, designed to be used as part of a *NIX pipeline. It can grab titles, links, metadata, and more from any web page. As part of its functionality, it can also use Firefox or Chrome to save screenshots, and that’s part of what I’ve improved.
The screenshot command now accepts a --script parameter. This can be a JavaScript string, or - to read from STDIN, or a path to a file which will be read and executed before taking a screenshot. You can also now define an element ID to wait for before taking the screenshot (or executing the script) using --id ELEMENT_ID. As long as the ID is a valid element on the page, the screenshot will trigger once that element is loaded (via HTML or dynamically), with a timeout of 10 seconds. You can also define a --wait X flag in the command to wait for a specified number of seconds after executing a script before the screenshot is taken.
Further, I’ve added a new subcommand, execute, that has the same parameters as above and simply allows you to load a page in the browser and execute a script on it. I really wanted this because it’s the easiest way to automate NiftyMenu:
curlyq execute -b chrome -s &quot;NiftyAPI.find(&#39;file/save&#39;).arrow().shoot(&#39;file-save&#39;)&quot; file:///Users/ttscoff/Desktop/Code/niftymenu/dist/MultiMarkdown-Composer.html
That command will save a screenshot of the File-&gt;Save menu item for me, allowing me to fully automate menu screenshots for any of my apps. I can have NiftyMenu generate an up-to-date view of the app’s menu bar, with styling for the current OS, and output detailed screenshots with callouts automatically. This will be a huge timesaver when it comes to documentation.
You can update/install the latest version of CurlyQ with gem install curlyq. The improvements in this post are available as of version 0.0.12. Enjoy!

      <description><![CDATA[ mac app; intention setting; Terminal trick; native macOS email client; keycap replacement
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一款简单优雅的Mac应用程序，可以帮助用户设定意图并提醒他们专注工作。还分享了一个适用于Terminal爱好者的技巧，并推荐了一款优秀的原生macOS邮件客户端。最后提到了订购了一个键帽来替换现有的定制键帽。 






Web excursions brought to you in partnership with CleanMyMac X, all the tools to speed up your Mac, in one app.

N₁₀ - Attention Management App for Mac
A simple, elegant Mac app that allows you to set an intention, define how much time you plan to put into it, and then just sit, quietly reminding you of what you want to be working on with subtle but all-encompassing animations. Perfect for those of us who say “OK, now I’m really going to work on this” and then find ourselves doing something entirely different within five minutes H/T Jason Rhemus and props to props to developer Sam Stephenson.
Again with man pages and BBEdit - All this
Really nice trick for Terminal junkies who use BBEdit. I have a similar trick for sublime, and one that opens man pages in Preview, but this one provides additional navigation that none of mine have.
Mimestream
“A native macOS email client for Gmail.” This looks so good, especially considering MailPlane is dead. If only I didn’t have iCloud and Exchange email accounts I need to deal with, too.
Interstellar Resin Keycap
I ordered this keycap to replace my custom rocket keycap that I use for my hyper key. Available in 2.25u (Enter) size. It should arrive today and I’m very excited. I’ll post pictures once I’ve installed it!

      <description><![CDATA[ Deckset, Markdown, OCR, Ground News, CleanShot X
总结:
文章介绍了一些最新的网络资源和工具。其中提到了Deckset推出iOS版本，用户可以使用Markdown在iPhone/iPad上创建演示文稿。另外推荐了一款基于Markdown的演示工具，可能比Deckset更好。还介绍了一个只适用于macOS 13+的简单命令行工具，可以使用内置的OCR和转录框架。提到了Ground News这个工具，可以帮助用户了解不同观点的新闻，打破信息茧房。最后作者推荐了CleanShot X用于截图和录屏。文章结尾提到网站受到读者支持，保留所有材料版权。 






Web excursions brought to you in partnership with CleanShot X, the absolute, hands-down best app for Mac screenshots. Get one of my all-time favorite apps here.

Deckset on the App Store
Just when I thought Deckset was dead, an iOS version is announced. Create presentations using Markdown, now on your iPhone/iPad.
iA Presenter
A newer option for Markdown-based presentations (from the creators of iA Writer and based on the same engine) that I think this might be even better than Deckset. Going to give it a test run for a while, but off the bat it looks really slick.
freedmand/textra
macOS 13+ only, a simple command line interface to the OS’s built-in OCR and transcription frameworks. The OCR works really well. Really, really well (I’m using it to add automatic ALT tags to Dimspirations and it deals with text in crazy fonts on crazy backgrounds). I haven’t gone far with testing the audio transcription, but I have high expectations.
Ground News
This is advertised on almost every YouTube channel I subscribe to, so I decided to check it out. It’s really good. If you want to break out of your news bubble and understand what the other side is hearing and thinking, Ground News provides all kinds of tools for doing so. Highly recommended. I’m trying to get my parents to use it, but even if they don’t, it helps me see the headlines that are going to affect them in their bubble so I’m not shocked when topics come up that I’ve seen no trace of previously.

I do all of my screenshots and screen recordings with CleanShot X. I love it to pieces. You should get it.

      <description><![CDATA[ 打印和交付，Sellfy，merchandise，BrettTerpstra.com，支持者
总结:
作者在BrettTerpstra.com上推出了新的商品系列，使用Sellfy进行印刷和交付。他计划在未来扩大选择，并根据反馈调整定价。他希望读者喜欢他的作品，并提供支持。 








I’ve created the initial round of merchandise for the Dimspirations Store. I know my sense of humor isn’t for everyone, which is why this whole project is on a different site.
I’ve started with some of my personal favorites as tees, mugs, and a 2024 calendar. The collection will grow over time (it’s print-on-demand, no cost to me to expand the selection). I’ll also adjust pricing based on feedback. I think the prices are pretty competitive based on what I’ve spent on merch myself.
I’m using Sellfy for the printing and delivery. I’ve used Spring in the past and checked out Printful and Cotton Bureau, but Sellfy seemed like the best solution with the most competitive pricing. I already paid for a 1-year package, so let’s hope it works out. If it does, I’ll probably relaunch the BrettTerpstra.com (Lab) merchandise there as well.
Please do check out the store, and if you like what you see, toss a couple bucks my way. And if you don’t see what you want, be sure to upvote your favorites Dimspirations by clicking the devil below each one. If you have special requests, of course let me know.
I’ll admit, this one is my favorite:

      <description><![CDATA[ Alfred, Bunch, Colorful nihilist memes, Hyper Key, Backblaze
总结:
Alfred的workflow Cluster与Bunch紧密集成，使生活变得更加轻松。还有色彩缤纷的虚无主义迷因来提高心情。此外，还有macOS上简单而强大的键盘增强工具，Backblaze可安全可靠地将整个计算机数据备份到云端。 Matt Webb的帖子谈论了科技走入了一个令人不安的境地，但或许这并不是件坏事。 






Web excursions brought to you in partnership with Backblaze. Back up everything.

Cluster (for Bunch)
Cluster is an Alfred workflow for use with Bunch, written by Stephen Millard. Closely integrates Bunch functionality with Alfred to make life even easier. I’m not an Alfred user myself, so I haven’t stress tested it, but if you are, please do and let Stephen and I know how it goes!
Nihilisa Frank on Tumblr
Colorful nihilist memes to make your day. Thanks to @adamrice for pointing this out.
Superkey
Simple and powerful keyboard enhancement on macOS. Want to add the Hyper Key with no fuss? Want to navigate your screen without touching your trackpad/mouse? This app looks really great at $16. h/t Mike Harahan on the forum.
Tech has graduated from the Star Trek era to the Douglas Adams age (Interconnected)
This post from Matt Webb speaks to me. Yes, tech has gone into a wobbly place better envisioned by Douglas Adams than by Gene Roddenberry, but maybe that’s an ok thing.

Backblaze securely backs up your entire computer to the cloud, affordably and reliably. I trust it with all my data. Check it out today.

On a whim I’ve put the new Dimspire.me site up on Product Hunt. I’ve been putting a lot of love into it and even if I were to stop now, I think it’s a great collection of nihilist inspirations (and wallpapers), enough to last quite a while. I’d love it if you’d take a second and leave a review.
Thanks!

      <description><![CDATA[ RSS feed, subscription, email, monetize, political

这是一篇关于Dimspire Me网站的文章，介绍了他们新增了RSS feed订阅和通过邮件订阅的功能。同时作者表示如果网站有商业化可能的话，将通过出售商品来实现，而不是收费订阅。作者还表示会尽量减少涉及政治的内容，因为有些读者对此表示反感。最后作者呼吁读者点赞和分享这篇文章以及支持他们的项目。总结：文章介绍了Dimspire Me网站新增的订阅功能以及未来可能进行商业化运营的打算，同时表示会尽量减少政治相关内容。 






I’ve added (well, fixed) the RSS feed for Dimspire.me. You can now subscribe via your favorite feed reader at Dimspirations RSS (or just enter https://dimspire.me in your subscribe field, the feeds are discoverable). The feed is available in XML and JSON flavors, and each entry just contains a pithy description and one image.
You can also sign up to receive Dimspirations in your email, max one email per day, and only when there’s new stuff:


Enter your e-mail address:




Dimspire Me


Thanks for supporting this little project. I’ve decided if I ever monetize it, it will be through merch (posters, calendars, coffee mugs, etc.). So the wallpapers and dismal inspirations will continue to be free online.
P.S. I’ve received some flack for occasionally going “political” with the Dimspirations. I don’t think things like being disgusted by a lack of gun control, being anti-genocide, or laughing at manufactured outrage are extreme political views, but I promise to keep those to a minimum. Sometimes I get a little fired up — don’t let it scare you away.

      <description><![CDATA[ Jekyll, insomnia, website, automation, dimspirations
总结: 这篇文章讲述了作者因失眠而产生创造力，制作了一个名为Dimspirations的网站。网站基于Jekyll架构，具有自动化功能，可以生成不同尺寸的壁纸，包括iPhone版本和方形版本。作者描述了网站的页面结构和功能，包括随机生成Dimspirations的功能和下载按钮的实现方法。作者还提到了对于网站的未来计划。整篇文章表达了作者对于自己创作的热情和对网站的期望。 






I couldn’t sleep last night. I’m not manic, I’m just going through this months-long bout of insomnia. At least I don’t think I’m manic. It doesn’t have any of the characteristics of my usual mania. And up until last night I wasn’t even getting out of bed when I couldn’t sleep. But last night I did, and I made you a website.
Introducing Dimspire.me. It’s built on Jekyll and has a bunch of automations. I can essentially create a “dimspiration” using an Affinity Photo template, and then RetroBatch will output wallpaper sizes (including iPhone) and square versions for posting and populating the gallery. Just running rake will find new photos added to the assets folder and generate posts for them, which will then populate the index pages. It should be pretty simple to maintain. All documented in a Howzit notes file, of course.
The site is pretty simple: a homepage with description and the latest few posts, a “Dimspirations” page that’s essentially a blog post index but done in gallery fashion, and a random dimspiration page that will just throw single random dimspirations at you. Fun stuff.
When viewing a single Dimspiration (by clicking on any thumbnail), you get some cool UI showing edges of the previous and next Dimspiration. I like it, anyway. There’s still some work to do on certain breakpoints, but overall the styling should work on any device. And every Dimspiration page has a download button, where you can download all available versions of the current Dimspiration. This is accomplished by a Rake task that parses every post, extracts the YAML key that defines the image for the page, then zips up every file in the assets directory that matches it. It creates a manifest table that shows what’s in the zip file, with each individual file linked. So when there are wallpaper versions of a Dimspiration, you can download the set or follow a link to a specific version. Took a little thinking and tweaking, but I think it’s a good solution.
I hope you enjoy it. It’s cathartic for me to create these, and they’re getting better with time. I’m not going to try to monetize any of this at this point, but I’ve watermarked all the images so if you share them, they should trace back to me. Speaking of, I do still need to consider adding share buttons to these… but it always freaks me out how much data social sites collect when you include their button, so I’ll need to figure out ways around that. We’ll call that “next step.”
Love always,
Brett

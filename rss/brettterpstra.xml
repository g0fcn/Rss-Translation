      <title>#dimspirations 回来了</title>
      <link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16571361/dimspirations-are-back</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ #dimspirations, automation, wallpaper, gallery, feedback
总结:作者创建了一个名为#dimspirations的系列“inspirational”海报，并自动化了壁纸格式的创建。作者考虑建立一个易于维护的网站来展示这些作品，并考虑通过Patreon等方式获取支持。读者被邀请分享反馈和建议。 






I’ve started creating Dimspirations again, my depressing-but-actually-realistic collection of “inspirational” posters. You can follow the hashtag #dimspirations on Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon, or Instagram for new posts. I’ve also automated the process of creating wallpaper-formatted version of them which get uploaded to Flickr and are also available as a zip (containing 5120x3200 and 2048x1366 versions). I should probably add an iPhone ratio to the automation, but they get harder to resize vertically from one image. Anyway, if you’re in the mood to be “dimspired,” check them out.
By the way, if you’ve never checked it out, the “Other Stuff” section (where my wallpapers are located) has some fun projects in it. Fun for me, anyway.
Side tangent: I own the domain dimspire.me, and have always meant to find a way to make an easy-to-maintain gallery out of these. Probably a blog-style thing with daily or weekly dimspirations, with basic comments functionality and links to download the square or wallpaper versions. The index page would just be a thumbnail gallery with the main image from each post. It might actually be nice to do a paywall and have the wallpaper versions supported by Patreon or something. I don’t know if anyone would actually pay for these. I’ve seen similar projects sold as books, and I feel like the designs are actually pretty good for print, so maybe someday. Anyway, my inclination is to do this site in Jekyll (which I’m very adept at), but would be open to any suggestions as to what the best way to accomplish this would be. I’m not even opposed to WordPress with some custom plugins (which I’m also surprisingly adept at), which would be pretty easy to automate and then I could use MarsEdit to maintain it. Still pondering.
In the meantime, please share your feedback (and any suggestions, should the dimspiration strike)!

      <description><![CDATA[ Find Any File, iThoughts, photo library, GUI, BrettTerpstra.com

总结:
本文介绍了几款实用的工具和应用，其中包括Find Any File，这是一款更新不断的应用，可以帮助用户进行准确的文件搜索，并且可以搜索NAS；iThoughts则是一款思维导图工具，虽然开发者已经停止更新，但仍然是一款值得推荐的应用；此外，还有一款用于整理照片库的工具，以及一款可以直接编辑Mac应用偏好设置的GUI工具。BrettTerpstra.com也提供了支持，读者可以选择是否点赞或分享。 






Web excursions brought to you in partnership with MindMeister, the best collaborative mind mapping software out there.

Find Any File
I’ve mentioned HoudahSpot plenty of times, but there’s an app that’s been around since about 2005 that has been continually updated and only costs $6-10 that’s worth checking out if you constantly run into hard-to-find files. One major benefit of Find Any File is that it can search your NAS and doesn’t rely on Spotlight for indexing. Searches can be a little slow but they are VERY accurate. Allows saving searches and search templates, and can export found files as a list for use in scripting app… uses a pay-what-you-can shareware model (oh, the old days!). Here’s a great review from Allison Sheridan with much more detail.
toketaWare has ceased trading
If you’ve followed me for the last few years, you know I swear by iThoughts for my mind mapping needs (of which I have a lot). I’m pretty devastated to see that the developer has moved on and there will be no future releases of the app on any platform. I checked in with him, he says he’s fine, he just moved on. Fair enough. Now I have to pick a new favorite mind mapping tool. Open to your thoughts!
Photoscope - Storage Cleaner on the App Store
A tool for cleaning up your photo library by easily selecting the best image from sets of multiple/burst photos. Well done and easy to use.
Prefs Editor
From the same developer who makes Find Any File, a very handy GUI for directly editing any Mac app’s preferences. Especially great for apps that have “esoteric” or hidden preferences that require using defaults commands in Terminal. Free!

      <title>检查 VPN 连接第 2 部分</title>
      <link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16553334/checking-for-a-vpn-connection-part-2</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ scutil, VPN连接, 脚本, grep, 网络接口

VPN连接状态检测的脚本可以通过使用scutil命令和grep来进行。通过检查返回值来确定VPN连接的状态，这个脚本可以让你更清晰地监控VPN的连接情况。总结: scutil命令和grep在脚本中被用来检测VPN连接状态，让你能够更有效地管理网络接口变化。 
Ok, so I wrote yesterday about a solution for checking your VPN connection via a network interface change, but it turns out there’s a better way to do it. I discovered it shortly after posting (StackExchange thread), and received a few comments mentioning it. So here’s part two.
The command is scutil, used for managing (s)ystem (c)onfiguration parameters. The command scutil --nc list will show your available VPN devices and their state, either Connected or Disconnected. By doing a case-sensitive grep for Connected we can determine if one or more is connected.
So now the script just look like:
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  RES=`scutil --nc list | grep -c Connected`
  [[ $RES == 0 ]] &amp;&amp; break
  sleep 1
done

say &quot;VPN disconnected&quot;
The scutil --nc list | grep -c Connected should return 0 if no VPN is connected, which you can then use to light up a button, integrate into launch/quit scripts, etc. Just a cleaner way to do what I showed yesterday.
Trevor Manternach has an interesting post using this trick with Wirecast and Bartender.

      <title>ScreenFloat 2 -- 增强你的屏幕截图 [赞助商]</title>
      <link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16547664/screenfloat-2-power-up-your-screenshots-sponsor</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ ScreenFloat, features, capture, annotations, organization
总结:ScreenFloat是一个强大的屏幕截图工具，具有多种新功能和工具，包括截图、标注、组织等。它可以让用户轻松地进行屏幕截图、录制屏幕、添加标注和整理截图，非常方便实用。ScreensFloat的新版本提供了诸多升级，能够让用户更加高效地进行屏幕截图和管理。 
Thanks to ScreenFloat for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! I was a frequent user of the original version, and I’m very excited to see version 2 released. It’s chock full of new features and tools that set it apart from the competition.








Hi, my name’s Matthias, I’m the developer of Yoink, Transloader, and Tameno, among others.
Allow me to introduce another one of my apps to you: ScreenFloat. Over eleven years after its initial v1 release, and after more than a year and a half of development, ScreenFloat 2 is finally here — rebuilt from the ground up, based on the core functionality that made it so beloved, but improving it in numerous, incredibly useful ways.
Capture screenshots, record your screen, or take timed screenshots. Re-capture shots without painstakingly reframing them. Import from your clipboard, other apps, your Desktop, or your iOS devices.
Float screenshots and recordings above all your other windows, apps and spaces, so information or reference material is always visible, no matter what you do. It’s like picture-in-picture, but for your captures.
Texts, faces and barcodes are detected in every shot you take and can effortlessly be extracted/copied and non-destructively redacted with a simple right-click.
Mark up and annotate your screenshots with lines, arrows, checkmarks, highlights, smart bullet points, redactions and more. All non-destructively, so you can always go back and make changes or restore the original capture.
Pick colors from any floating shot. Crop, “fold”, resize, rotate, “de-retinize”, trim, and mute your shots.
Sharing floating shots is just a file drag away, with on-the-fly changing of file format and sizing options, whether or not annotations should be included, and more.
Set up double-click workflows for repetitive tasks, like de-retinize the shot, resize it to 75% and then attach it to an email.
Your captures are stored in ScreenFloat’s Shots Browser, where you can name, tag, favorite and rate them, and organize them with folders and smart folders. They can also (optionally) be synchronized across your Macs over iCloud.
Find all your shots system-wide or in the Shots Browser by their metadata — including detected text and barcode content.
And more!
A screenshot is just a screenshot. Until you use ScreenFloat. Check it out today.

      <description><![CDATA[ ScreenFloat, CleanShot X, macOS, Backblaze, keybindings
总结:本文介绍了Matthias Gansrigler发布的ScreenFloat v2，以及macOS中隐藏的代理图标的显示技巧。另外还推荐了一款可以调查macOS文本系统按键绑定的应用程序。同时还提到了一个有关双相情感障碍生活的纪录片。文章最后介绍了Backblaze，这是一款用于将计算机数据安全备份到云端的工具。
 






Web excursions brought to you in partnership with Backblaze. Back up everything.

Eternal Storms Software - ScreenFloat
Matthias Gansrigler has released v2 of ScreenFloat, one of my favorite apps from years ago. A lot of its functionality was replaced by CleanShot X for me in recent years, but the shots browser, tagging, and smart folders set it apart. The basic idea is you can float a screenshot above all other windows and it follows you between spaces, but v2 goes a lot further. Check it out.
TipBITS: Always Show Window Proxy Icons
Back in 2020 I published a tip to make the now-hidden proxy icons in macOS show up instantly on rollover, but it turns out that since then Apple has added a preference to just show them all the time. Thanks to Pim for pointing this out.
davidbalbert/KeyBinding-Inspector
An app to survey your macOS text system keybindings. I’ve been writing a lot about editing the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file, and this app makes it easy to peruse what key combinations are doing what. The biggest shortfall is that it doesn’t handle nested bindings (multi-keystroke), but it does successfully ignore those and show you everything else.
Commit Art
Turn your contributions into a tangible piece of art! Mine for 2023 is a documentation of my bipolar type 2 life.

Backblaze securely backs up your entire computer to the cloud, affordably and reliably. I trust it with all my data. Check it out today.

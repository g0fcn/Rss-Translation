      <title>本周我是 AppStories 的嘉宾</title>
      <link>https://rknight.me/blog/i-was-a-guest-on-appstories-this-week/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ MacStories, AppStories+, fediverse, ActivityPub, development setup总结:最近几周MacStories每周都邀请不同的主持人，这周轮到作者亲自参与。在AppStories+的预展中，他们讨论了节目的起源；在正式节目中，他们探讨了fediverse和ActivityPub，分享了作者的一些开发设置。节目最后，还有一段关于主持人Federico对作者人格的看法，这让作者感到震惊。你可以选择用你喜欢的播客软件收听这一集，或者观看视频版本。 
The past few weeks AppStories has had a different MacStories host as a guest and this week was my turn. In the AppStories+ pre-show we talk about the origins of Ruminate and in the main show we discuss the fediverse and ActivityPub, some of my projects, as well as my development setup. Stick around to find out what kind of person Federico thinks I am because I&#39;m still reeling.

      <title>水牛城辣酱食谱</title>
      <link>https://rknight.me/blog/buffalo-sauce-recipe/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ 辣酱、大蒜、辣椒酱、黄油、食醋总结:这是一个制作水牛城辣酱的食谱。首先将辣酱、切碎的大蒜、辣椒酱和食醋放入锅中，用中高火加热并搅拌，煮5分钟直至略为浓稠。然后降低火力，慢慢加入无盐黄油搅拌均匀。最后，在离火后加入少许黄原胶使辣酱更加稠密。整个过程简单快捷，适合喜欢辣味的人尝试。 
I don&#39;t know where I got this recipe but it&#39;s buffalo sauce so I suspect it&#39;s mostly the same from everyone but here we are, final day of recipe week. Enjoy.







Buffalo Sauce
300g Hot Sauce4 Garlic Gloves20g Worcestershire Sauce15g Distilled Vinegar120g Unsalted Butter
Add hot sauce, garlic gloves, worcestershire sauce, and distilled vinegar to sauce pan over medium high heat. Whisk ingredients together and allow to cook for 5 minutes until thickened slightly.

      <link>https://rknight.me/blog/leek-and-bacon-jacket-potatoes-recipe/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ 土豆, 培根, 韭菜, 奶油奶酪, 微波炉总结:这是一种美味的夹克土豆制作方法。首先将土豆用微波炉加热15分钟，期间翻转一次。然后在烤箱中继续烘烤土豆。接着将切好的培根在锅中煎至变色，加入韭菜煎2-3分钟，再加入奶油奶酪、黑胡椒和辣椒粉调味搅拌均匀。最后将土豆切半，加入一些黄油和韭菜培根混合物，撒上一些辣椒粉即可食用。 
Day six of Recipe Week. This is certainly not healthy in any way at all but god damn is it tasty.







Leek and Bacon Jacket PotatoesThere are many ways to make a jacket potato, I choose the microwave way because it&#39;s quicker.

2 Jacket potatoes8rashers Chopped Bacon40g Leeks165g Cream CheeseBlack PepperPaprikaButter
Pre-heat the oven to 200°c. 
Jab your jacket potatoes with a fork a handful of times and put in the microwave for 15 minutes, turn halfway through.
Put your jackets in the oven while you make the topping.
Cook the chopped bacon in a pan with a little bit of oil until browned off, then add in leeks and fry those for 2-3 minutes. Turn the heat down and add in cream cheese, black pepper, and paprika, and stir it all together.
Cut your jackets in half, add some butter to them, then top with the leek and bacon topping. Sprinkle some paprika on top to serve.

      <title>命名我的计算机</title>
      <link>https://rknight.me/blog/naming-my-computers/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ 设备命名, Marvel角色, iPhone, AirPods, Beats Studio buds总结:本文作者介绍了自己为电子设备命名的方法，其中大部分以Marvel角色为主。例如，他的Mac Mini被命名为J.A.R.V.I.S，MacBook Pro和iPhone尚未提及命名，Apple Watch和AirPods Pro的命名未被透露。而AirPods Max因材质被命名为Metal。此外，作者为Beats Studio buds起了一个与众不同的名字——Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them，而iPad因使用不频繁而简单地命名为Robb&#39;s iPad。这种命名方式给作者的设备增添了一份个性和趣味。 
Alex has an excellent post about how they name their computers which is, as they mention, a very important part of setting up a new device.
Unlike Alex, I don&#39;t choose a new name when it gets replaced - my iPhone is always called Starlord. Which brings me to the naming scheme: Marvel characters. Some of these make sense, some of them don&#39;t.

Mac Mini: This is used for Plex and some other boring home things but it&#39;s the hub for the house or something. Anyway I went with Jarvis. Technically it&#39;s written J.A.R.V.I.S. but who&#39;s got time for that.
MacBook Pro: This is my main computer and is called Vision.
iPhone: Starlord
Apple Watch: Rocket
AirPods Pro: Maximoff. Because there&#39;s two of them? A clever one.
AirPods Max: Magneto because metal
My black Apple Magic keyboard: Black Widow

My Beats Studio buds are the one exception to this naming rule because I thought of a name[1] so good I couldn&#39;t not use it: Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them. My iPad is called Robb&#39;s iPad because I don&#39;t use it enough to name it.



I originally thought of this joke for this tweet ⤾

      <title>更多关于 Bluesky 的杂乱想法</title>
      <link>https://rknight.me/blog/more-unorganised-thoughts-about-bluesky/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ Bluesky, 自托管, 储存空间, ActivityPub, 骚扰总结:文章讨论了Bluesky平台及其与其他社交媒体的对比，尤其是技术实现和使用Bluesky的理由。自托管Bluesky较复杂，需要4.5TB的存储空间，远超单一PHP文件的可能性。同时提到Bluesky可能是Twitter的简化替代品，而Fediverse作为去中心化的跨平台连接器。在Mastodon平台上，边缘化群体面临骚扰的情况被提及，这也是一些人选择Bluesky的原因之一。作者最后考虑自己托管PDS，以便在需要时更容易地管理数据。 
I got a lot of feedback from my last post which fell into two categories: either about the technical implementations or why someone is using Bluesky over other options. As soon as my sent my previous post Bluesky started having outages which has made looking into the feedback interesting to say the least but they&#39;ve been adding obscene amounts of users every second today.
Technical
MCG and Matt linked me to this post which is titled &quot;How to self-host all of Bluesky except the AppView (for now)&quot;. There are more components to self-hosting Bluesky than say, Mastodon, but it is doable. Sort of. You can&#39;t do the AppView which &quot;aggregates data from across the Atmosphere to produce their UIs&quot;. It&#39;s late and I don&#39;t have the energy to translate what that actually means but it sounds important.
The part that jumped out to me (after MCG mentioned it) is the article mentions needing 4.5tb of storage for the relay which is a fuckton and might as well be a million terabytes for the sake of discussing self-hosting. There is a second relay option called Jetstream which from my reading of it, can be used instead of the 4.5tb version. Looking at the docs it&#39;s not ideal for all circumstances but if we assume it could work for a small user base then cool. This is, however, a far stretch from my question of could it be done on a single PHP file. Seems like that&#39;s going to be a no. ActivityPub is by no means simple but AT Proto seems infinitely more complicated.
Why use it?
The why is harder. There&#39;s no accounting for what people like or enjoy, people just do. A lot of it came down to just a feeling of what Bluesky is like (early Twitter was banded around a bit).
Friend of the show Alex Cox pointed out to me, a cis white dude, that marginalised people on Mastodon are subject to constant reply guys and harassment. I&#39;m embarrassed that I didn&#39;t even think of it.

Most marginalized people who joined mastodon.social or another generic instance bounced pretty quickly because not many want to stick around and learn how to create your own instance when in the meantime you’re constantly blocking random guys telling you you’re doing it/everything wrong

As an aside, most of the reports we deal with on social.lol are spam probably because the instance is paid so there&#39;s a barrier that doesn&#39;t exist on mastodon.social and the other big instances.
Final Thoughts
Ben has a great post here about Bluesky, the Fediverse, and the future of social media:

Bluesky may evolve into a streamlined alternative to Twitter, while the Fediverse could serve as a decentralized, cross-platform connector among diverse networks

There&#39;s no reason to believe both can&#39;t continue to exist side by side. Mastodon isn&#39;t going anywhere and if better tools for self hosting come around for Bluesky, I could see myself potentially using both.
This is too much for one person to think about protocols[1] but I do want to investigate hosting a PDS if only because my data could be deleted easily by me without relying on Bluesky to do so if something were to happen. I think this is the case although I suppose it&#39;d be in other relays? Something to look into.



Especially after last week&#39;s recipe saga ⤾

      <title>关于蓝天的杂乱想法</title>
      <link>https://rknight.me/blog/unorganised-thoughts-about-bluesky/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ Bluesky, API, Starter Packs, Mastodon, 交叉发布总结:这篇文章主要记录了作者对社交网络Bluesky的一些初步感受和思考。首先，作者觉得Bluesky的API设计相对其他社交网络来说比较奇异，开发者需要手动标记话题、提及和链接，并且需要自己处理链接预览。作者也提到了Bluesky的Starter Packs功能虽然受到了一部分人的喜爱，但他本人更倾向于用户能够通过浏览内容后再做关注决定。此外，作者对比了Bluesky和Mastodon，不太理解为什么有人会从Mastodon转到Bluesky。最后，作者还提到了自己如何通过交叉发布保持与粉丝的互动，并且他对社交平台的交互持开放态度。 
These thoughts about Bluesky are unorganised and mostly off-the-cuff so make of that what you will.
The API, even just for posting, strikes me as very strange. I, as the developer, have to mark which things are hashtags, mentions, and links unlike Twitter, Mastodon, and basically every other network. If I want link previews I have to do that too.
The Personal Data Store is interesting. I haven&#39;t set one up but Brandon and Rafael did and it seems easy enough but this is just one part of the AT Protocol. Is it possible to host the entire stack yourself without relying on bsky.social? Can you be part of the AT Protocol with a single PHP file? That might sound stupid but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable bar to interact with a network even if it&#39;s in a limited way.
Starter Packs are a good idea that people seem to like but I would rather people followed me because they&#39;ve had a gander at what I post and decided to follow. Choosing to follow people en masse without looking at those profiles seems weird to me. The other thing is it feels like they pigeon-hole people into being a specific version of themselves and perhaps give unrealistic expectations to people following[1]. I feel the same about mastodon instances focused around a specific topic.
I&#39;ve seen a few people drop Mastodon for Bluesky but I don&#39;t really understand why, nothing about it jumps out at me as all that different to Mastodon. You have to go where your people are though so it could just be that. I&#39;m pretty sure Bluesky will get enshittified before too long and everyone will be onto the next thing.
I am cross-posting my posts and links to my Bluesky account with EchoFeed. People are there, they presumably followed me to see my things, and I don&#39;t lose anything if the service blows up overnight. POSSE, baby.
I setup my own install of SkyBridge so I can use Ivory to read my Bluesky timeline because none of the apps are as good as Ivory and probably never will be.
I&#39;ve updated my verify page to reflect the fact that I am using Bluesky.



&quot;Stop posting about politics, stay in your lane&quot; ⤾

This recipe came to me via my friend Ali, who had it at The Flatiron Room when he was living in New York. He&#39;s made it for us a bunch of times, including on my stag do, as you can in the accompanying photo.

      <title>与现实的联系</title>

      <description><![CDATA[ 。 




随着我们经历大量人工智能生成内容的增加，本文将介绍与现实和自然的联系不仅为您的业务和手艺，而且为您自己带来的作用和附加价值。
取得平衡
几年来，散步或徒步旅行一直是我每周的习惯，也是我最喜欢的活动之一。
我发现在办公室/家外散步并与周围世界保持联系至关重要，无论是在大自然中还是在城市周围。这对于像我这样每天在电脑前工作的人来说尤其重要。
我喜欢沉浸在数字世界中，思考抽象的概念，并使用数字设备，例如将这些内容传达给你。但和其他任何事情一样，需要保持平衡，数字领域和现实领域之间的平衡似乎至关重要。

与现实联系的附加价值
随着生成模型的改进，越来越多的人会认为给定的文本、图像或视频可能是假的，我相信通过亲身体验、旅行、精神或认证实体的数字内容消费等体验与现实世界建立联系的需求会增加。
能够证明自己与现实世界和真实人物有联系的企业和创作者可能会在噪音中脱颖而出。
因此，如果您正在创建一家企业、一段内容或任何东西，请思考它与现实世界有何关联。问问自己：您如何提供这种联系？您如何提供现实即服务？
让自己与现实保持联系
除此之外，同样重要的是，您要保持与现实的联系。
因此，如果您觉得自己在互联网、数字设备、电视剧等方面花费了太多时间，我邀请您到户外，到外面的世界去。它是免费的，可以访问。您只需要打开门走出去，前提是您足够幸运，拥有所需的身体能力。我确信它会让你的生活变得更好。]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ Einstein, ramble, safety, environment, agency
总结:文章讲述了爱因斯坦的故事和作者自己的体会。爱因斯坦常常徜徉在自己的思绪中，而作者则喜欢在漫步中思考问题、策略和得出结论。他认为这种思维过程的基础是安全感。环境对一个人的影响很大，不安全的环境会限制思考和行动，而拥有选择的权利则能让人有更多自主权决定生活的方向。因此，我们应该尽量控制可以控制的部分，做出对长远有利的选择。 
Einstein’s rambles
I’ve been listening to the “Einstein: His Life and Universe” audiobook, from Walter Isaacson, which recounts a series of curious stories of how he carried himself through his life.
Einstein was often known to be aloof and lost in this thoughts, so much so that when sailing his clunky 15-foot sailboat named Tinef (Yiddish for “worthless” or “junk”), he often found himself to being rescued more than once by locals near to his rented a summer cottage overlooking Cutchogue Harbor.
Another delightful story was when he lived in Princeton, where occasionally, he would take rambling walks on his own. One day, called into the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked, and asked to speak to a particular dean. When the secretary said that the dean wasn’t available, he hesitantly asked for Einstein’s home address. That was not possible to give out, he was informed. His voice then dropped to a whisper. “Please don’t tell anybody,” he said, “but I am Dr. Einstein, I’m on my way home, and I’ve forgotten where my house is.”
Thinking, in safety
Over the past years, I’ve made a habit of having at least one long walk / hike every weekend. I take immense joy - if I happen to go by myself and I’m not actively listening to an audio book or am concentrating on some task - to just wander around and immerse myself in random thoughts, think about hard problems, strategise, and attempt to arrive at sound conclusions. This mental wandering, almost like a meditation, I am sure that happens for most of us, in several instances. Maybe when waking up, during the shower, during a walk, during a boring talk, when contemplating art or nature, etc.
Since we are not omniscient and omnipresent, we have several limitations in knowing how a given action will translate into a set of consequences, so we use probabilistic models and heuristics in our thought processes to discern which are the most likely actions that will help us arrive at a desirable outcome. And the more relevant information and time we have to process our thoughts, the better our results will be.
In all of these, I believe there is one common denominator that is fundamental for that process to happen: safety.
The influence of one’s environment
Let’s assume you live with access to information and resources (food, money, shelter, etc), but are living in a situation where your surrounding environment requires you to keep alert and attentive to hazard to your physical / mental wellbeing, or you are in a situation where your social stability is dependent on incapacitating amounts of your energy and time. This could be due to living in a dangerous neighborhood, having overly demanding peers, an abusive household, etc.
Even though there might be a series of limited actions one could take to improve their situation, the constant fight-or-flight severely restricts the opportunities where these action plans can be considered, which eventually leads to reactive actions that could have a number of possible outcomes (good or bad), rather than surgical long term actions that would pave the path towards positive outcomes.
The takeaway
While many many situations are not under our control, such as our initial conditions, birth place, etc, which place a default upper bound on any possible outcomes, we do have agency over some parts of our life, and that is what we can focus on. The path to unwanted consequences is a slippery slope made of several small decisions, some under our control, others not. But for the ones we have the opportunity to control, we should.
For example, the peers one choses to have around, the choice to avoid short term pleasures that have a high long term cost, the choice of which country or neighborhood to live in, the choice of which job offer to strive for, etc.
Do notice that the italics are intentional. The choices above assume that those are options you have under your control to pick, which I am conscious that is not always the case.]]></description>
